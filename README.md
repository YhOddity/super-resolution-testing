# Testing Procedure for Super Resolution

This repository contains an illsutration of the numerical experiments performed in the paper entitled
"Testing Gaussian Process with Applications to Super-Resolution" by Jean-Marc Azaïs, Yohann De Castro and Stéphane Mourareau.

## Python code

The Python code can be downloaded at 

https://github.com/ydecastro/super-resolution-testing

The file 'aux.py' contains all the auxilliary functions. The file 'testing_superresolution.py' is illustrated in the notebook 'testing_super_resolution.ipynb'.

It requires at most:

python>=3.6.4

numpy>=1.14.0

scipy>=1.0.0

matplotlib>=2.1.2

seaborn>=0.8.1

## Getting started

Once you have downloaded the two files testing_superresolution.py and aux.py, you can execute testing_superresolution.py to make the numerical experiments of the paper. The notebook 'testing_super_resolution.ipynb' is an illustration of this code. It should take you between 15 to 30min to run all the experiments below (for less than iterations<=500).

Thank you for your time!
