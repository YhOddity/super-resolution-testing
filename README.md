# Testing Procedure for Super Resolution

This repository contains an illsutration of the numerical experiments performed in the paper entitled
"*Testing Gaussian Process with Applications to Super-Resolution*" by Jean-Marc Azaïs, Yohann De Castro and Stéphane Mourareau.

[Download file on the ArXiv (arXiv:1706.00679v3)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.00679v3)

Chapter 6 (Pages 25-29) of version 3.

## Python code

The Python code can be downloaded at 

[Github repository super-resolution-testing ZIP file](https://github.com/ydecastro/super-resolution-testing/raw/master/super-resolution-testing.zip)

The file **aux.py** contains all the auxilliary functions. The file **testing_superresolution.py** is illustrated in the notebook 'testing_super_resolution.ipynb'.

It requires at most:

python>=3.6.4

numpy>=1.14.0

scipy>=1.0.0

seaborn>=0.8.1

## Getting started

Once you have downloaded the two files **testing_superresolution.py** and **aux.py**, you can execute *testing_superresolution.py* to make the numerical experiments of the paper. The notebook **testing_super_resolution.ipynb** is an illustration of this code. It should take you between 15 to 30min to run all the experiments below (for less than **iterations**<=500 montecarlo simulations).
